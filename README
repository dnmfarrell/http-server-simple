=head1 NAME
HTTP::Server::Simple::PSGI

=head1 DESCRIPTION
This Perl 6 module provides a lightweight in process web server that
conforms to the Perl Server Gateway Interface specification.  It should
work exactly like the Perl 5 version.

The PSGI spec replaces CGI with something equally simple, but Perl
specific and likely to be more efficient because of not spawning
child processes.  Read the SEE ALSO links below for more information.

Unfortunately the Perl 5 test suite is limited to only verifying that
the module loads and compiles ok.  Admittedly it is hard to test I/O
based software such as a web server, but it would be worth the effort to
try.

The Perl Dancer project uses HTTP::Server::Simple::PSGI in Perl 5.  The
initial motivation for this work was to enable the development of a
Perl 6 version of Dancer.  That work can begin only after this
foundation proves itself.

The documentation is written in Pod6 to get some experience with the
format.
