README for HTTP::Server::Simple::PSGI

The Perl Server Gateway Interface is a more powerful and efficient web
server API than CGI.  Several well known Perl 5 products are based on it,
for example Plack and Dancer.  This Perl 6 based project offers the same
web server foundation on Rakudo, to assist the porting of such web
frameworks to Perl 6.

The object hierarchy follows its Perl 5 based prototype closely, except
where the CGI concerns were not separated from the web server.  In this
Perl 6 implementation the PSGI concerns are fully separated from the CGI
ones.
